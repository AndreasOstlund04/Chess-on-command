# Chess-on-command
Chess on the windows command line, for a school project. Yes the name is a pun, no I will neither apologise nor change it.

As the name implies the goal of this project is to get chess running on the windows command line, cmd.exe
There are some more advanced features planned, a chess engine to play against or possibly
with, some fancy schmancy interface stuff like a title screen that plays the immortal game in
the background.

I may at some point try and make this thing work on linux, but thats far from gauranteed.
